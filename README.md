# Quake2InfectedMod
Trying to make a Quake 2 Infected Mod for IT266 class @ NJIT

So far:

You can log in the game and the console will tell whether you are infected or non-infected. 

Infected people will have a blaster in their hand and they can only use it to melee other players.
FIXME: Non-infected players also have to melee i haven't figured out how to make the change.

Once you have the melee blaster gun in your hand you cant pickup any other weapon. Unfortunately this is also true for non-infected. 
Tried to fix this but to no avail.

Players can inflict damage on each other with melee, but i havent implemented any actual infection where non-infected become infected once they get hit. etc..
